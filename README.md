# Bad Usb Scripts
 
 These scripts are executed using a Raspberry Pi Pico.
 
 All of these scripts are for WINDOWS 11 only. 
 
 Some may or may not work for older versions.
 
 Use only on computers you are allowed to 
 
 I am not liable for who else uses this script
 
All Scripts are purely python

In order to excecute scripts, you must change it to a DD file by adding .dd at the end 

Ex: WifiHarvester.txt --> WifiHarvester.dd
