# Bad Usb Scripts
 
 FOR LEGAL USEAGE ONLY
 ---------------------
 
 Description: These scripts are executed using a Raspberry Pi Pico. The Raspberry Pi Pico is assumed as a keyboard when plugged in 
 and can use "malicious" premade scripts to excecute anything that a normal user could with an unoccupied unlocked computer could do.
 
 All of these scripts are for WINDOWS 11 only. 
 
 Some may or may not work for older versions. 
 
 This is just a proof of concept and nothing more.
 
 All Scripts are purely python

 In order to excecute scripts, you must change it to a DD file by adding .dd at the end 

 Ex: WifiHarvester.txt --> WifiHarvester.dd

 Use only on computers you are allowed to 
 
 I am not liable for how this is used
